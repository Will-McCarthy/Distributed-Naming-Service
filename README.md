# Consistent	Hashing-based	Naming	Service

## Introduction

In this project, you are going to implement a consistent hashing (CH)-based flat naming system.
As we studied in the class, consistent hashing provides a lookup service for key-value pairs. The
CH system stores (key, value) pairs on a distributed set of servers. These servers collaboratively
provide lookup service along with insertion and deletion. In this project, you will implement the
CH name servers and a boot-strap CH server, which is a special CH server with certain extra
functionalities. In order to simplify the implementation, several assumptions are made as
follows.

1. The keys are assumed to be numbers in the range [0, 1023] (both inclusive). This
    mitigates the need for an extra hash-function. You can use the key value itself as the
    hash-value.
2. Values are assumed to be alphanumeric strings (no special characters).
3. The CH name server IDs are also numbers in [0, 1023] range.
4. The Bootstrap name server has the ID 0. This will be a permanent node in the system. In
    other words, the system starts up by having only this bootstrap name server in the
    system (i.e., starting up this Bootstrap name server starts up the system). The Boot strap
    name server does not exit the system (when it closes down the DHT system is assumed
    to have closed down).
5. The lookup, insertion and deletion operations are executed only at the Bootstrap name
    server. It provides a thread to interact with users and accepts lookup, insertion and
    deletion commands (see below for more details).
6. The name servers (including the bootstrap name server) interact with one another using
    sockets primitive.
7. Please note that you are implementing consistent hashing, which means that each name
    server only knows about it predecessor and successor name servers.
8. It is assumed that the bootstrap name server is known to all other name servers (i.e., it
    is provided at startup).
9. The entry and exit processes of name servers always start at the bootstrap nameserver.
10. Entry, lookup, insertion and deletion traverse the servers in clockwise direction (i.e., by
    following successors).
11. You can assume that there will not be any race conditions in the system (i.e.,
    simultaneous lookups, insertions, deletions, entries and exits).


## Bootstrap	Name	Server

As mentioned above the bootstrap name server is a permanent name server. Its startup signals
the creation of the CH system and its close-down brings the entire system down. It is assumed
that the Bootstrap name server is the first node in the system. In other words, at startup it is
responsible for the entire [0, 1023] range.

The Bootstrap name server (bnserver) takes a single command line parameter – the name of
the bootstrap name server configuration file (bnConfigFile). The bnConfigFile has the following
format:

ID of the server (which is 0, as it is the Bootstrap name server)
Port number on which the Bootstrap server will wait for
connections from other servers.
A series of initial key value pairs. One pair per line (key and value delimited
by blank space).

An example bnConfigFile is available here (http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~laks/DCS- 2021 -
Sp/pp4/bnconfig_example.txt)

Upon startup the Bootstrap name server will manage the entire [0, 1023] range until other
servers join the system. The Bootstrap name server will also provide a user interaction thread.
The user interaction thread will support the following commands.

lookup key à retrieves the value corresponding to the given key (if the key is in the
system). If the given key is not in the system, “Key not found” should be printed. In addition to
the value, this commands should also printout the sequence of server IDs that were contacted
and the ID of the server from which the final response was obtained.

Insert key value à should insert the key value pair into the system. The command
should print out the ID of the server into which the key value pair was inserted and the
sequence of server IDS that were contacted.

delete key à should delete the key value pair corresponding to the given key. If
successfully deleted, “Successful deletion” should be printed. If key was not in the system “Key
not found” should be printed. In addition, the sequence of server IDs that were contacted in
the deletion process should be printed.

## Name	Server

These are non-permanent servers in the system. Each name server has an ID (specified in the
configuration file). Each name server is responsible for maintaining the key, value pairs for a
specific range of keys as specified in the consistent hashing algorithm. Each name server knows
its predecessor and successor name servers (i.e., it maintains the IP address and port number of
its predecessor and successor name servers).

The Name server (nameserver) takes a single command line parameter – the name of the name
server configuration file (nsConfigFile). The nsConfigFile has the following format:


ID of this name server (number in [1, 1023] range)
Port number on which this server will wait for connections from
other servers.
IP address and port number of the Bootstrap server (delimited by
space).

An example nsConfigFile is available here (http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~laks/DCS- 2021 -
Sp/pp4/nsconfig_example.txt)

Each name server will also provide a user interaction thread. The user interaction thread will
support the following commands.

enter à the name server will enter into the system. This process is initiated by first
contacting the Bootstrap server. It will figure out the range of the keys that it should maintain
by following the consistent hashing protocol (i.e., traversing the existing name servers in clock-
wise direction). It will acquire the key value pairs corresponding to its range from the name
server that will become its successor name server. Once the entire entry procedure is complete,
“successful entry” message is printed out. In addition, the following information is printed out:
(1) The range of keys that will be managed by this server; (2) the ID of the predecessor and
successor name servers; (3) the IDs of the servers that were traversed during the entry process.

exit -> the name server will gracefully exit the system. The name server will inform its
successor and predecessor name servers. It will hand over the key value pairs that it was
maintaining to the successor. Upon successful exit, the server will print “Successful exit”
message. It will also print out the ID of the successor and the key range that was handed over.

Points to Note:

1. Several design decisions (such as messaging formats between name servers and data
    structures to be used in servers etc.) have been deliberately omitted. Coming up with a
    good design is a very important part of the project.
2. You are allowed to make reasonable assumptions (if need be). However, those
    additional assumptions should not be contrary to the original CH protocol (for example,
    you should NOT assume that every name server knows about every other name server
    in the system). It is a good idea to talk to the instructor before making additional
    assumptions. The assumptions should also be mentioned in the readme file.
3. Evaluation will be done through demos.


## Compiling:
